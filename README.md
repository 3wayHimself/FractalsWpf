## Description

This repo is my attempt at exploring fractals in C# / WPF.

## TODO

* Get a basic visualiser working
* Parallelise the calculations (e.g. using Parallel.For)
* Run the calculations on the GPU using OpenCL
* Enhance the UI to allow different areas to be explored and zoomed into
* Make the UI look nice e.g. by using [Material Design In XAML Toolkit](http://materialdesigninxaml.net/)

## Links
